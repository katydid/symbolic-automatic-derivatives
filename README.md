# ReProving Agda in Lean

This project translates the paper ([Symbolic and Automatic Differentiation of Languages - Conal Elliott](http://conal.net/papers/language-derivatives)) from Agda to LeanProver.

The goals of this project are to:

  - Discover the differences between Agda and Lean4.
  - Define proofs on `Type` instead of `Prop`, since each proof represents a different parse of the language.
  - Avoid tactics if possible, in favour of simple `trfl` (our version of `rfl`).

## Requirements

This project requires setting up lean, see the [official documentation](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html).

## Trivial differences from the Agda implementation

### Equality `‚â°`

Lean has `Prop` and `Type` and Agda has `Set`, which we can think of as `Type` in Lean. We want out proofs to be proof revelant, since each proof represents a different parse of our language. This means the theorems have to be defined on `Type`. For example we have equality redefined in terms of `Type` as `TEq` (using the syntax `‚â°`) and  we replace `rfl` with `trfl`, but we do not a replacement tactic for `rfl`.

```lean
inductive TEq.{tu} {Œ±: Type tu} (a b: Œ±) : Type tu where
  | mk : a = b -> TEq a b

def trfl {Œ± : Type u} {a : Œ±} : TEq a a := TEq.mk rfl
```

We needed to redefine the following types and functions to use `Type` instead of `Prop`:

| Description  | Prop  | Type  |
| :---         | :---: | :---: |
| equality     | `=`   | `‚â°` in [Tipe.lean](./Sadol/Tipe.lean)  |
| equivalance  | `Mathlib.Logic.Equiv.Defs.Equiv`  | `TEquiv` or `<=>` in [Function.lean](./Sadol/Function.lean) |
| decidability | `Decidable`  | `Decidability.Dec` in [Decidability.lean](./Sadol/Decidability.lean) |

When write proofs, we cannot rewrite using the `rw` tactic, but we need to destruct equalities, to do rewrites for us:
```
cases H with
| refl =>
```

### Simply renamings

Some things we renamed since they are simply called different things in Agda and Lean, while others were renamed to be closer to the Lean convention.

| Description  | Original Agda | Translated Lean |
| :---         | :---:         | :---:           |
|              | `Set`         | `Type`          |
| universe levels  | `‚Ñì`, `b`  | `u`, `v`        |
| parametric types | `A`, `B`  | `Œ±`, `Œ≤`        |
| isomorphism      | `‚Üî`       | `<=>`           |
| extensional isomorphism | `‚ü∑` | `‚àÄ {w: List Œ±}, (P w) <=> (Q w)` |

### Namespaces / Qualified Imports

We use namespaces as much as possible to make dependencies clear to the reader without requiring "Go to Definition" and Lean to be installed.

| Description        | Original Agda | Translated Lean   |
| :---               | :---:         | :---:             |
| `List Œ± -> Type u` | `‚óá.Lang`      | `Language.Lang`   |
| `List Œ± -> Œ≤`      | `‚óá.ŒΩ`         | `Calculus.null`   |
| `(List Œ± -> Œ≤) -> (a: Œ±) -> (List Œ± -> Œ≤)` | `‚óá.Œ¥`     | `Calculus.derive` |
|                    | `Dec`         | `Decidability.Dec`     |
|                    | `Decidable`   | `Decidability.DecPred` |

### Syntax

We dropped most of the syntax, in favour of `([a-z]|[A-Z]|'|_|\.)*` names.

| Description  | Original Agda | Translated Lean |
| :---         | :---:         | :---:           |
| nullable     | `ŒΩ`           | `null`          |
| derivative of a string  | `ùíü` | `derives`      |
| derivative of a character    | `Œ¥`  | `derive` |
|              | `‚àÖ`           | `emptyset`      |
|              | `ùí∞`           | `universal`     |
| empty string | `ùüè`           | `emptystr`      |
| character    | ` c           | `char c`        |
|              | `‚à™`           | `or`            |
|              | `‚à©`           | `and`           |
| scalar       | `s ¬∑ P`       | `scalar s P`    |
|              | `P ‚ãÜ Q`       | `concat P Q`    |
| zero or more | `P ‚òÜ`        | `star P`        |
| decidable bottom  | `‚ä•?`     | `Decidability.empty` |
| decidable top     | `‚ä§‚ÄΩ`     | `Decidability.unit`  |
| decidable sum     | `_‚äé‚ÄΩ_`   | `Decidability.sum`   |
| decidable prod    | `_√ó‚ÄΩ_`   | `Decidability.prod`   |
| `Dec Œ± -> Dec (List Œ±)` | `_‚ú∂‚ÄΩ` | `Decidability.list` |
| `(Œ≤ <=> Œ±) -> Dec Œ± -> Dec Œ≤` | `‚óÉ` | `Decidability.apply'` |
| decidable equality   | `_‚âü_`  | `Decidability.decEq` |
| decidable denotation | `‚ü¶_‚üß‚ÄΩ` | `decDenote` |
| denotation           | `‚ü¶_‚üß`  | `denote` |

All language operators defined in `Language.lagda` are referenced in other modules as `‚óá.‚àÖ`, while in Lean they are references as qualified and non notational names `Language.emptyset`. The exception is `Calculus.lean`, where `Language.lean` is opened, so they are not qualified.

### Explicit parameters.

We use explicit parameters and almost no module level parameters, for example `Lang` in Agda is defined as `Lang Œ±` in Lean. In Agda the `A` parameter for `Lang` is lifted to the module level, but in this translation we make it explicit.

### Reordering of definitions

In Lean definitions need to be in the order they are used. So for example, in `Automatic.lean` `iso` needs to be defined before `concat`, since concat uses `iso`, but in `Automatic.lagda`, this can be defined in any order.

Also each function signature and its implementatio is grouped together in Lean, while in the Agda implementation the function type signatures are grouped together and the implementations of those functions are much lower down in the file.

## Non-Trivial differences from the Agda implementation

## Proofs of Contradiction

Agda seems to be better at using type inference to infer bottom, while Lean typically prefers the use of a tactic.

For example, proving the derivative of the empty string is the empty set, requires proving a few cases of bottom (`‚ä•` in Agda and `PEmpty` in Lean). In Agda these proofs are completed with type inference:

```agda
Œ¥ùüè  : Œ¥ ùüè a ‚ü∑ ‚àÖ
Œ¥ùüè = mk‚Üî‚Ä≤ (Œª ()) (Œª ()) (Œª ()) (Œª ())
```

In Lean we need to use the `contradiction` tactic or the proof becomes very long.

```lean
def derive_emptystr {Œ±: Type u} {a: Œ±} {w: List Œ±}:
  (derive emptystr a) w <=> emptyset w := by
  apply TEquiv.mk <;> (intro x; cases x) <;> contradiction
```

For non Lean users: `<;>` is similar to the Monad bind operator (`>>=`) over proof goals. It takes a list of goals to prove and applies the following tactics to each of the goals, which each produce another list of goals, which are all joined together into one list.

## Coinduction / Termination Checking

Lean does not have coinduction, which seems to be required for defining `Automatic.Lang`. We attempt an inductive defintion:

```lean
inductive Lang {Œ±: Type u} : Language.Lang Œ± -> Type (u+1) where
  | mk
    (null: Decidability.Dec (Calculus.null R))
    (derive: (a: Œ±) -> Lang (Calculus.derive R a))
    : Lang R
```


But this results in a lot of termination checking issues, when instantiating operators in [Automatic.lean](./Sodal/Automatic.lean).

For example, when we instantiate `emptyset`:
```lean
-- ‚àÖ : Lang ‚óá.‚àÖ
def emptyset {Œ±: Type u}: Lang (@Language.emptyset.{u} Œ±) := Lang.mk
  -- ŒΩ ‚àÖ = ‚ä•‚ÄΩ
  (null := Decidability.empty)
  -- Œ¥ ‚àÖ a = ‚àÖ
  (derive := fun _ => emptyset)
```

We get the following error:
```
fail to show termination for
  Automatic.emptyset
with errors
failed to infer structural recursion:
Not considering parameter Œ± of Automatic.emptyset:
  it is unchanged in the recursive calls
no parameters suitable for structural recursion

well-founded recursion cannot be used, 'Automatic.emptyset' does not take any (non-fixed) arguments
```

This seems to be a fundamental issue in regards to how inductive types work.
We can get around this issue by using `unsafe`:

```lean
-- ‚àÖ : Lang ‚óá.‚àÖ
unsafe -- failed to infer structural recursion
def emptyset {Œ±: Type u}: Lang (@Language.emptyset.{u} Œ±) := Lang.mk
  -- ŒΩ ‚àÖ = ‚ä•‚ÄΩ
  (null := Decidability.empty)
  -- Œ¥ ‚àÖ a = ‚àÖ
  (derive := fun _ => emptyset)
```

This issue was probably inevitable, given that the Agda version of Lang in [Automatic.lagda](https://github.com/conal/paper-2021-language-derivatives/blob/main/Automatic.lagda#L40-L44) required coinduction, which is not a feature of Lean:

```agda
record Lang (P : ‚óá.Lang) : Set (suc ‚Ñì) where
  coinductive
  field
    ŒΩ : Dec (‚óá.ŒΩ P)
    Œ¥ : (a : A) ‚Üí Lang (‚óá.Œ¥ P a)
```

Note, the Agda representation also encountered issues with Agda's termination checker, but only when defining the derivative of the concat operator, not all operators as in Lean. Also this was fixable in Agda using a sized version of the record:

```agda
record Lang i (P : ‚óá.Lang) : Set (suc ‚Ñì) where
  coinductive
  field
    ŒΩ : Dec (‚óá.ŒΩ P)
    Œ¥ : ‚àÄ {j : Size< i} ‚Üí (a : A) ‚Üí Lang j (‚óá.Œ¥ P a)
```

We hope to find help to remove the use of `unsafe` in Lean or that it is possible to fix using a future `coinductive` feature.

Apparently there are libraries in Lean that support coinduction, but none that support indexed coinductive types, which is what we require in this case.

Also note, [sized types in Agda are fundamentally flawed](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/2820), so whether Agda can represent Automatic.Lang without fault, is also an open question.
